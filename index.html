    <h2 id="history">A short history of bicycles</h2>
    <p>The earliest precursor to the bicycle was the draisine or “running machine” invented in Germany in 1817. This was a wooden frame with two wheels and handlebars that was propelled by pushing with the feet. Over the next several decades, several inventors attempted to create a powered bicycle, but it wasn't until the early 1860s that the first true bicycle was invented. This bicycle had a pedal-driven chain that turned the wheels, making it easier to propel and control the vehicle.<br/><br/>

As bicycles became more accessible and affordable, they became increasingly popular for transportation and recreation. By the late 19th century, bicycles were widely used in Europe and North America, and mass-produced models were available. Bicycles were also used in competitive sports, and the first road race was held in France in 1868.<br/><br/>

In the early 20th century, the safety bicycle, with equal-sized wheels and a chain drive, became the most popular type of bicycle. Bicycles also played an important role in the women's suffrage movement, as they gave women greater mobility and independence. During World War II, bicycles were used for transportation, since gasoline was in short supply.<br/><br/>

Today, bicycles continue to be a popular mode of transportation, especially in cities where traffic congestion and environmental concerns make cycling a convenient and eco-friendly option. Bicycles are also widely used for exercise and recreation, and competitive cycling is a popular sport around the world. Advances in technology have led to lighter and more efficient bicycles, making cycling easier and more accessible than ever before.</p>
